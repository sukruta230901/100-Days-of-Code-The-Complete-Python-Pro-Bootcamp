#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#For example the total bill was &150.00 and the bill is to split between 5 peoples then, each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. 

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
